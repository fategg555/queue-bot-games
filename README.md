# Queue Bot Games (aka Queuey Boi)

Bot that manages queues in a non technologically advanced way


## How this works

You can add this bot (below) and refer to the (soon to be updated) `qhelp` command for all the commands


## Made by sweaty hands and a lessened desire to do anything else

this was a cool project with a non existent use case

use at your own peril

Add the bot from [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=515330544968400937&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com&scope=bot).
I was lazy and didn't actually make a redirect, working on that now
enjoy and leave any suggestions/comments/roasts somewhere on this github idk
