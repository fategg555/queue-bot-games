# Queue Bot Games (aka Queuey Boi)

Bot that manages queues using embeds and reactions


## How this works

You can add this bot (below) and refer to the (soon to be updated) `qhelp` command for all the commands and their arguments


## Made by sweaty hands and a desire to click discord reactions

Add the bot from [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=515330544968400937&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com&scope=bot)

I was lazy and didn't actually make a redirect, working on that now

bot works if server members are active, if your members didn't respond to pings, this won't awake them from their hibernation

enjoy and leave any comments somewhere on this github
